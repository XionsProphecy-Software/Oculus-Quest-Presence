### Files
- Download the <a href="https://github.com/madmagic007/Oculus-Quest-Presence/releases" target="_blank">latest release</a> and unzip it.
- Download and install <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/#/download" target="_blank">SideQuest</a> on your PC.
- Download <a href="https://github.com/tverona1/QuestAppLauncher/releases" target="_blank">Quest app launcher</a>.

### On Your PC
- Use SideQuest to sideload the `Quest App Launcher apk` and the `Quest Discord RPC apk` (from the zip)
- Run `oqrpc.exe` to install the client on your PC (from the zip)
- After the installer is finished, run the `Oculus Quest Discord RPC.jar`
- In SideQuest, check the top left corner to see the IP address of your Quest. It should look something like this: `192.168.x.x`
- Enter this IP address into the popup window.

### On Your Quest
- Open the `Quest App Launcher` found under `Library > Unknown Sources`
- Select the `2D` tab and look for the `oqrpc.apk`. It will now prompt you for permissions.
- Select `oqrpc` and toggle it on. Press the `B` button on your controller to navigate back.

You can now go back to your PC and press the `validate` button in the popup window. It should tell you that the apk is running. Restart your quest and a notification should appear on your computer telling you that it is online. Your Quest games will now appear in your Discord rich presence.

## Settings

- When you restart your computer, the program on the pc should start automatically, this can be disabled if you right click the icon, hit "open settings" and toggle the "start with windows boot" checkbox.
- If you open the settings and hit the save log button, it will save a file with all the app names that your device has come across that aren't listed in my lang.json file. You can always send me that file so i can add it to the list!

## Known Issues

- Loss of internet connection for more than one minute will stop showing the presence. Right click on the oculus quest rpc icon in the system tray on your computer and hit "Request presence to start".
- Both programs *should* automatically start with device boot, but that may not always the be case. If the presence didn't start but the program on the pc is running, hit the "Request presence to start" button. If you didn't get a message saying your quest is online, then you have to manually start the app from the quest app launcher.
- If you quest connects to wifi within 3 minutes of powering on, it will automatically start displaying the presence on Discord. If it doesn't, you may have to manually start the app.
- Game presence names are based on the package. For Pavlov, this would be "com.vankrupt.pavlov". These are then mapped to a proper name using the `lang.json` file found in this repository. If no name mapping is available, it will take the last piece of the package name instead. For example, `com.vankrupt.pavlov -> pavlov`

## Troubleshooting / questions

#### - I open the .jar file but nothing happens
- The window asking for the ipv4 address only shows up on the first time opening the program. To see if the program is running look in the system tray. If an icon looking like a quest shows, that means that it is running.
- The program requires java to run, make sure you have that installed.
#### - It keeps saying "error finding device"
- Make sure both your quest and pc are connected to the same wifi network, that the quest is powered on and that the entered ip is correct.
#### - It only says "device found, but apk is not running on device"
- Check if the program is actually running on your quest. If it is open, hit the "terminate presence" button and restart the apk. 
#### - I did everything and it said "device found and apk is running on device", but the presence isn't showing
- Check if you got the notification on your pc saying that your quest is online. If you received that, it means that the quest has connected to the pc and the error is with discord. If you didn't get that notification, make sure that the apk is running on your quest.
- Discord for web browser won't detect games running on your pc, so make sure you are using the desktop application.
- Check the settings in discord and make sure that game presence is enabled.
- Try running the jar via commandline by using the command `java -jar "path_to_jar`. Doing this fixed it for some people in the past, i have no idea why though.
#### - It was working before and it randomly stopped working
- Dynamic ip addresses can change after a while, open the settings window and make sure that the ip there is the same as the one found in SideQuest. You can also assign a static ip address to your quest.
- If the ip is correct, follow the steps above this.
#### - The presence is showing, but it shows a weird name
- Read the last part of the 'knows issues section'. Open the settings window: right click icon in the system tray > open settings and hit the "save log" button. Your default text editor will open and in the window a bunch of package names should be listed. Send me the contents of that file in discord.
##### If none of these steps helped, contact me on discord (link at the top).  

#### - Do i need to set the ip every single time?
- No, the window asking for the ip only comes up if no ip has been set before, or that it doesn't find one in the config file. 
#### - Will this work for mac/linux?
- For mac, download jar from <a href="https://github.com/madmagic007/Oculus-Quest-Presence/raw/master/pc/out/artifacts/pc_jar/Oculus%20Quest%20Discord%20RPC.jar">here</a> and place this is a folder where no admin privlegses are required to edit files. I dont have an installer yet because I dont know how to work with mac. 
- Linux has no support yet, you can try downloading the jar but that most likely won't work properly on linux.
#### - Does my pc needs to be on all the time?
- If you want to show the presence then yes, if you dont want to have it show then your pc can be turned off.
#### - Will this affect performance/battery life on my quest?
- This is a very light application so it shouldn't be noticeable at all. However keep in mind that it is yet another application that is running in the background.
